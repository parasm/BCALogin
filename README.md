### How does it work?
<p>Simply enter your username and password the first time you open the extension.</p>
<p>From then on out it will sign you in automatically every 10 minutes.</p>
<p>If you are in-between the 10 minutes and do not want to wait, simply click on the extension and it will sign you in.</p>
<p>If it is says Successfully Signed In! but you are not being signed into the wifi, you have most likely enter your login information incorrectly. Click not the extension and let it sign you in and then click on the Clear Saved Login button.</p>
